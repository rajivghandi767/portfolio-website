## ðŸš€ Overview

This repository contains the source code for my portfolio website, which showcases primarily showcases my Backend & Dev Ops skills, projects, and experience as a self-taught Software Engineer as well as my personal interests of travel & collecting credit card points.

The website is built with a Django REST backend and a React Typescript frontend, and is hosted locally on my Raspberry Pi4B using Docker and Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Django REST API**: Backend API built with Django REST Framework for serving dynamic content.
- **React Frontend**: A modern React.js frontend that interacts with the Django backend.
- **Dockerized Environment**: Both the frontend and backend are containerized using Docker for easy setup and consistency across environments.
- **Jenkins CI/CD**: Jenkins is used to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **Dynamic Content**: Projects, Blog and Card data are served from the backend API.
- **Dark Mode**: Includes support for dark mode.
